Lilburne Chandler, for exceptant. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="9" id="pa9">A petition was filed by Benjamin R. Lee and others, at this term, to change the course of a public road in Pencader hundred. Said petition set out, inter alia, the following facts: "That there is need of a change in a part of a public road in said Pencader hundred for the convenience of the general public; said public road leading from Newark to Delaware City; the change needed being that part of the said public road beginning at or near where it crosses the right of way of the Newark &amp; Delaware City branch of the Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp; Washington Railroad Company, at or near what is commonly known and designated as Dayett Station; said public road continuing in a southeasterly direction on the easterly side of the said right of way of said railroad company until it reaches a point at or near where the said public road again crosses the right of way of the said railroad company at or near what is commonly known and designated as 'Kenney Station'; the object of the above change being to lay out the public road on the westerly side of the said right of way of the said railroad company, thereby making the public road safer, shorter, and better. * * *" The return of the commissioners followed the description of the road as given in the above petition. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="10" id="pa10">Joseph P. Nichols, one of the owners of the land affected by vacating and changing said public road, filed and relied upon the following objections to the record and return: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="11" id="pa11">"No. 4. That Morris D. Crossan, one of the persons named to lay out and change said public road described in said petition, is not a suitable person to act as one of said commissioners; he being unacquainted with the locality, and being a resident of Wilmington hundred, and was not and is not a freeholder. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="12" id="pa12">"No. 5. That the petition fails, to describe with reasonable precision the termini of said public road. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="13" id="pa13">"No. 6. That the petition fails to describe with reasonable precision the place of beginning of said change in said public road. * * * </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="14" id="pa14">"No. 8. That the return fails to state what portion of the costs the persons who inclose the vacated public road ought to pay, respectively, and the same is not set out in the return, as by law required."<span page-number="863" pagination-id="60 A. 862" id="p863"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="15" id="pa15">Mr. Cooch, for petitioners: I move that the above objections to the return of the commissioners be quashed and set aside, and that the return be confirmed. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="16" id="pa16">The objections are answered, according to number, as follows: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="17" id="pa17">No. 4 is insufficient in law and untrue in fact. It is insufficient in law, as no requirement is made, nor does the law contemplate, that commissioners or "road jurors" shall be freeholders; the requirement being that the commissioners shall be "suitable persons." The law refers to them by such titles as "five suitable persons," "persons," "road jurors," "commissioners," etc., not as "freeholders." It is untrue in fact, as the said Morris D. Crossan, being engaged in real estate business, is familiar with the value of farming land, is acquainted with this locality and the dangers of the railroad crossings sought to be avoided by the proposed change, and is in other regards a "suitable person." </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="18" id="pa18">LORE, C. J. The court hold that the fourth objection is insufficient </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="19" id="pa19">Mr. Cooch: Nos. 5 and 6: The petition sets out with reasonable precision the termini and place of beginning of said change in said public road. The objection should have been made before the petition was approved and the commissioners were appointed, and therefore cannot be considered at this time. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="20" id="pa20">LORE, C. J. We think the place of beginning and also the termini of the public road are described with sufficient particularity in the petition and return. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="21" id="pa21">Mr. Cooch: No. 8: The law does not require that the return shall set out "what portion of the costs the persons who enclose the vacated public road ought to pay respectively," when the order is made on a petition for changing the course of a public road, but only on an order for vacating a public road; the return for a change being merely that the commissioners "shall determine what part of the old road shall be vacated on opening the new, and who shall enclose the same." </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22">LORE, C. J. We overrule objection No. 8. The return is confirmed. </p> </section><hr> </body></html>
