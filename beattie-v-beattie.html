She is seeking damages for paralyzing injuries she sustained in an automobile accident where her husband was the driver. The trial court properly followed the prior precedents of this Court and relied on the common law doctrine of interspousal immunity ("the Doctrine") which prevents one spouse from suing the other in tort. We have concluded, however, that the Doctrine is no longer a viable concept and no longer meets the needs of modern society. Accordingly, we hereby overrule our prior precedents and <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>REMAND</b> to the Superior Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. </p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <h3>I. FACTS</h3> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="15" id="pa15"> On July 15, 1991 defendant-appellee, Michael Beattie ("Husband"), struck the back of a slow moving truck engaged in weed spraying operations on the median of Route 1 near Milford, Delaware. At the time of the collision he was driving a 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass in which his wife, plaintiff-appellant, Margaret Beattie ("Wife"), was a passenger. His wife sustained serious injuries in the accident which have rendered her a quadriplegic. Her medical bills and expenses are in excess of $286,000. On December 17, 1991, Wife filed a negligence action against her Husband.<a note-disclosure="1" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#b23d8b51-3b50-4b3c-9f77-2f9b48ed0d7c-fn1"></a> At the time of the accident, he was covered by a substantial liability insurance policy on the vehicle. Despite the suit, the Beatties have remained married and have no plans to divorce.  </p><div note-container="1" id="b23d8b51-3b50-4b3c-9f77-2f9b48ed0d7c-fn1"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="16" id="pa16"> Also named as defendants were Asplundh Tree Expert Co. and Robert L. Boyles, the owner and operator, respectively, of the truck with which the Beattie vehicle collided.</p> </div> <h3> <b>II. PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUPERIOR COURT</b> </h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="18" id="pa18"> On February 25, 1992, Husband filed a motion for summary judgment against his wife claiming that the Doctrine barred her negligence claim. The trial court granted the motion, but requested that an amended motion for summary judgment be filed. On June 23, 1992, the Superior Court issued an order granting the amended motion for summary judgment.<a note-disclosure="2" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#0aaec23e-0faa-4b50-bf39-0cc5da09ffbd-fn2"></a> Thereafter, the wife appealed the decision. Following oral argument before a panel of three justices, the matter was scheduled for re-hearing <i>en Banc</i> and <i>amicus curiae</i> briefing was permitted. The sole issue before this Court is whether the Doctrine should be abrogated and, if so, to what extent.  </p><div note-container="2" id="0aaec23e-0faa-4b50-bf39-0cc5da09ffbd-fn2"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="19" id="pa19"> While the Superior Court requested that an amended motion for summary judgment be filed encompassing a cross-claim asserted by codefendants Boyles and Asplundh, the Superior Court ultimately declined to grant summary judgment as to that cross-claim.</p> </div> <h3> <b>III. RATIONALE OF THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION</b> </h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="21" id="pa21"> The trial court's decision granting summary judgment is based upon the Doctrine. This antiquated doctrine was first applied by Delaware courts in the seminal case of <i>Plotkin v. Plotkin,</i> Del.Super., 32 Del. 455, 125 A. 455 (1924). In <i>Plotkin,</i> the Superior Court adopted the Doctrine primarily on the belief that upon marriage, the identity of the wife merged with that of the husband. The Doctrine's continued existence in Delaware since 1924 has been justified as a means of promoting family harmony and discouraging collusion and fraud upon insurance companies. <i>Saunders v. Hill,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/saunders-v-hill" class="raw-ref">57 Del. 519</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/saunders-v-hill#p808" class="raw-ref">202 A.2d 807, 808</a> (1964) (the "absolute legal unity of husband and wife has been substantially eroded by the Married Women's Property Acts" and instead the Doctrine is justified as a means to promote family harmony and discourage collusion and fraud). After most recently reviewing the Doctrine in 1979, this Court held that "it retains sufficient merit to warrant continued adherence." <i>Alfree v. Alfree,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/alfree-v-alfree#p162" class="raw-ref">410 A.2d 161, 162</a> (1979). </p> <h3> <b>IV. STANDARD AND SCOPE OF REVIEW</b> </h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="23" id="pa23"> The issue is whether the Doctrine remains a viable concept in Delaware jurisprudence. The trial court's decision is supported by existing Delaware case law which recognizes the antiquated Doctrine. <span page-number="1098" pagination-id="630 A.2d 1096" id="p1098"></span> The validity of the Doctrine has been called into question. Accordingly, this issue poses a legal question which is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>Fiduciary Trust Co. v. Fiduciary Trust Co.,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/fiduciary-trust-co-v-fiduciary-trust-co#p930" class="raw-ref">445 A.2d 927, 930</a> (1982); <i>Duvall v. Charles Connell Roofing,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/duvall-v-charles-connell-roofing" class="raw-ref">564 A.2d 1132</a> (1989). </p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <h3>V. ABROGATION OF THE DOCTRINE</h3> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="27" id="pa27"> It is well settled that the judiciary has the power to overturn judicially-created doctrine, so long as that doctrine has not been codified in a statute. <i>Duvall v. Charles Connell Roofing,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/duvall-v-charles-connell-roofing" class="raw-ref">564 A.2d 1132</a> (1989); <i>Traveler's Indemnity Co. v. Lake,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/travelers-indem-co-v-lake" class="raw-ref">594 A.2d 38</a> (1991). Furthermore, it is the duty of this Court to review common law rules to ensure that the conditions and policy objectives that justify the rules remain relevant and valid.<a note-disclosure="3" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#78791688-293f-4dde-b2c9-2eec9faac9f9-fn3"></a> Relying on the case of <i>Saunders v. Hill,</i> Husband argues, conversely, that changes in well-settled public policy must be effected by the General Assembly. <a href="https://casetext.com/case/saunders-v-hill#p810" class="raw-ref">202 A.2d at 810</a>. This reliance is misplaced, however, because the case is factually distinguishable. In <i>Saunders</i> the General Assembly had enacted controlling legislation.<a note-disclosure="4" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#967b6ff1-b38b-4942-8d42-9527ad5fb097-fn4"></a> In the present case, there is no statute that directly applies to the Doctrine. Therefore, it is within the authority of this Court to abrogate the common law doctrine if it no longer merits recognition.   </p><div note-container="3" id="78791688-293f-4dde-b2c9-2eec9faac9f9-fn3"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="28" id="pa28"> <i>See Brooks v. Robinson,</i> Ind.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/brooks-v-robinson-3" class="raw-ref">259 Ind. 16</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/brooks-v-robinson-3#p797" class="raw-ref">284 N.E.2d 794, 797</a> (1972) ("The strength and genius of the common law lies in its ability to adapt to the changing needs of the society it governs.").</p> </div><div note-container="4" id="967b6ff1-b38b-4942-8d42-9527ad5fb097-fn4"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="29" id="pa29"> Husband's reliance on <i>Wright v. Moffitt,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/wright-v-moffitt" class="raw-ref">437 A.2d 554</a> (1981), and <i>Samson v. Smith,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/samson-v-smith" class="raw-ref">560 A.2d 1024</a> (1989) is also misplaced. In those cases the Court refused to <i>create</i> a new cause of action. In the present case the Court is being asked to <i>remove</i> a judicially created limit on a cause of action.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="30" id="pa30"> This Court refused to abrogate the Doctrine in <i>Alfree,</i> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/alfree-v-alfree#p162" class="raw-ref">410 A.2d at 162</a>, despite the renunciation of the parental immunity doctrine in <i>Williams v. Williams,</i> Del.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-williams-26" class="raw-ref">369 A.2d 669</a> (1976). <i>Williams</i> held that the promotion of family harmony and the discouragement of collusive and fraudulent claims were unacceptable justifications for the parental immunity doctrine "in light of contemporary conditions and modern concepts of fairness." <i>Id.</i> at 671. The <i>Alfree</i> Court declined to abrogate the Doctrine because it was then perceived that the effects would be far-reaching and the problem was "more appropriate for legislative solution than for judicial determination." <i>Alfree,</i> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/alfree-v-alfree#p163" class="raw-ref">410 A.2d at 163</a> (citation omitted). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="31" id="pa31"> The <i>Alfree</i> Court's rationale for retaining the Doctrine included: 1) the preservation of family harmony and 2) the prevention of fraud and collusion. <i>Id.</i> at 162. These were the same rationales that were rejected with regard to parental immunity in <i>Williams.</i> It is inconceivable that suits between children and parents are less likely to disrupt family harmony than interspousal suits. This is also true with respect to property claims and actions for breach of contract, which are actionable in the family context. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="32" id="pa32"> In our view, the Doctrine is more likely to have the effect of disrupting family harmony rather than preserving it. Denying a person compensation for injuries arising from the negligence of his or her spouse can be very disruptive ( <i>e.g.,</i> large medical bills and loss of wages often result from serious accidents). Under the Doctrine, the married couple will have to pay these huge expenses, instead of relying on insurance proceeds. This added financial burden could well promote marital discord. <i>Hack v. Hack,</i> Pa.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hack-v-hack" class="raw-ref">495 Pa. 300</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hack-v-hack#p866" class="raw-ref">433 A.2d 859, 866</a> (1981). Any destruction of family harmony that is prevented by the Doctrine is likely to be minimal due to the prevalence of liability insurance. In addition, the Doctrine may actually promote divorces because a person who suffers an injury at the hands of his or her spouse, but who has since divorced the spouse, may maintain a tort action against the former spouse. <i>Hudson v. Hudson,</i> Del.Super., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hudson-v-hudson-3#p624" class="raw-ref">532 A.2d 620, 624</a>, <i>appeal refused,</i> Del.Supr., 527 A.2d 281 (1987). Accordingly, it is conceivable that spouses may decide to divorce solely to bypass the restrictions of a Doctrine which putatively is designed to <span page-number="1099" pagination-id="630 A.2d 1096" id="p1099"></span> preserve marital harmony. Such a result is repugnant to public policy. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="33" id="pa33"> Because of the prevalence of liability insurance, Husband argues that collusion and fraud will increase if spouses are able to sue each other. It is true that the adversarial system may be subject to tension because it is in the defendant spouse's interest for his or her injured spouse to receive some compensation, especially when the insurance company is the "real" party being sued. Such tension could potentially lead to a threat of corruption. Although the possibility of collusion exists in various situations such as intrafamily cases and suits between friends, the judicial system is adept at ferreting out frivolous and unfounded cases.<a note-disclosure="5" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#2e63f22a-6127-4352-ba83-94abd167cd19-fn5"></a> It is unnecessary and unwise to deny legitimate claims in order to prevent fraudulent and collusive suits because the judicial system contains numerous safeguards and deterrents against fraudulent claims such as perjury charges and modern discovery procedures.<a note-disclosure="6" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#65b63fbc-f57c-493a-9c20-225a7ff5f0ac-fn6"></a> <i>Luna v.

The danger of fraud has come to seem no greater than in many other cases where suit is allowed, such as the hostguest case or the suit between friends, and in any event it is now thought that the remedy for fraudulent claims is to expose the fraud rather than to discard all the honest claims along with the bad ones. Similarly, it has come to seem doubtful that peace and harmony of the home can be preserved or restored by refusing to redress a palpable wrong or to compensate a genuine injury, and there is no reason to believe that personal injury claims are more disruptive than property claims, which are actionable.</blockquote>  <br> W.

Paiewonsky,</i> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/paiewonsky-v-paiewonsky-2" class="raw-ref">446 F.2d 178</a> (3d Cir. 1971), <i>cert. den.,</i> 405 U.S. 919, 92 S.Ct. 944, 30 L.Ed.2d 788 (1972). <i>Paiewonsky</i> held that the Doctrine did not discriminate "against women who marry" so as to violate their right to equal protection. <i>Id.</i> at 181-82. The holding was based on the finding that the Doctrine had a "reasonable relationship" to the goal of promoting domestic tranquility. <i>Id.</i> at 182. Because it is not necessary to the disposition of the case at bar, we withhold judgment as to the constitutionality of the Doctrine.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="51" id="pa51"> For the most part, interspousal lawsuits typically are initiated when the tortfeasor has sufficient insurance coverage to provide for the damages. From this fact, Wife argues that the Doctrine should be abrogated only to the extent that liability insurance coverage protects the negligent spouse. Under this theory, a negligent spouse is immune from tort liability for damages in excess of his or her liability insurance coverage. One reason for the limit is that it avoids the problem of one spouse executing on marital property to satisfy an excess judgment. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="52" id="pa52"> In the absence of a statute, the Court finds no reason to limit suits between married persons to insurance coverage while imposing no restrictions upon other suits. Also, making insurance coverage the limit on liability may have the practical effect of leaving the injured spouse far from compensated for his or her suffering. In the present case, the Husband was covered by substantial insurance, but in cases where the tortfeasor spouse has very little or no insurance, the injured spouse will be limited <span page-number="1101" pagination-id="630 A.2d 1096" id="p1101"></span> to recovering insufficient damage awards or no award at all. Having concluded that the Doctrine is no longer based on sound public policy grounds, this Court should not retain restrictions that would have the effect, at least in some instances, of preserving the Doctrine. In our view, it is not appropriate to deny or limit a right based upon the existence of insurance coverage. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="53" id="pa53"> In addition, although the present case involves the rule of interspousal immunity for negligence rather than an intentional tort, it is reasonable to conclude that there is "no logical or legal reason for drawing a distinction between the two." <i>Klein v. Klein,</i> Cal.Supr., <a href="https://casetext.com/case/klein-v-klein-2" class="raw-ref">58 Cal.2d 692</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/klein-v-klein-2#p103" class="raw-ref">26 Cal.Rptr. 102, 103</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/klein-v-klein-2#p71" class="raw-ref">376 P.2d 70, 71</a> (1962). We realize that marital harmony is lacking where spouses intentionally harm one another. There is logic to the argument that, in cases where the parties have since divorced, there is little, if any, justification for barring an injured spouse from suing for intentional torts as well.<a note-disclosure="13" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#37c6a312-b1e8-4cea-87b3-b79e8d9844a5-fn13"></a> The case before us is a negligence case, however, and the intentional tort case is not before us. Nevertheless, it appears that the rationale underlying the abrogation of the Doctrine in the context of negligence actions would apply to intentional torts.<a note-disclosure="14" href="https://casetext.com/api/search-api/doc/beattie-v-beattie/html#e84b6aeb-4082-4524-8016-de017a42650b-fn14"></a>   </p><div note-container="13" id="37c6a312-b1e8-4cea-87b3-b79e8d9844a5-fn13"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="54" id="pa54"> The <i>amicus curiae</i> brief of the Section on Women and the Law of the Delaware State Bar Association ("DSBA") argues that abrogation of the Doctrine with respect to intentional torts is necessary because neither Delaware divorce law nor Delaware criminal law provide adequate remedies for intentional torts committed against spouses. Assuming the existing law is inadequate, it does not necessarily follow that abrogation of the Doctrine is the sole answer. Other methods of reform include a modification of existing criminal or divorce law through legislative initiative.</p> </div><div note-container="14" id="e84b6aeb-4082-4524-8016-de017a42650b-fn14"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="55" id="pa55"> The General Assembly may wish to consider a specific statutory enactment which would clearly set the public policy of this State in all aspects of interspousal causes of action sounding in tort.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="56" id="pa56"> As a separate issue, the parties requested permission to submit supplemental briefs addressing the question whether abrogation of the Doctrine would require a modification of the evidentiary rules, specifically Delaware Rule of Evidence ("D.R.E.") 411. <a href="https://casetext.com/rule/delaware-court-rules/delaware-uniform-rules-of-evidence/article-iv-relevancy-and-its-limits/rule-411-liability-insurance" class="raw-ref">D.R.E. 411</a> provides: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="57" id="pa57">  </p><blockquote id="bq58" bq-id="58"> Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether he acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.</blockquote>  <p></p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="59" id="pa59"> Husband's argument that some modification to customary trial practice should be made in suits between spouses fails because it is based solely on the assumption of a high risk of collusion between spouses. <a href="https://casetext.com/rule/delaware-court-rules/delaware-uniform-rules-of-evidence/article-iv-relevancy-and-its-limits/rule-411-liability-insurance" class="raw-ref">D.R.E. 411</a> specifically provides that the rule does not require the evidence of insurance against liability be excluded when offered to show bias or prejudice of a witness. Thus, collusion issues are contemplated by the rule in its current form. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="60" id="pa60"> As previously stated, the risk of collusion is not unique to interspousal litigation. In addition, empirical evidence shows that fears of rapidly increasing collusive suits due to the abrogation of the Doctrine are unfounded. None of the states which have abrogated the Doctrine have reinstated it. <i>Shearer v.

CONCLUSION</h3> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="64" id="pa64"> We find that the Doctrine is a relic from the common law that is no longer a viable concept and no longer meets the needs of modern society. The overwhelming majority of states in this nation have already abrogated the Doctrine without negative repercussions. Accordingly, we overrule <i>Alfree</i> and reject the Doctrine as a defense in this case. </p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> </section><hr> <section class="decision opinion"> <p class="byline"> VEASEY, Chief Justice: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="67" id="pa67"> <span page-number="38" id="p38"></span> </p> </section><hr> </body></html>
